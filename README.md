TrackGuessrTrackGuessr is a full-stack web application that gamifies your Spotify listening history. By integrating with the Spotify Web API, it generates interactive quizzes based on either your personal "Top Tracks" or real-time "Global Hits." FeaturesSpotify OAuth 2.0 Integration: Secure login flow allowing users to authenticate directly with Spotify.Personalized Quizzes: Generates questions based on the user's most-played songs (Top 50 tracks).Global Hits Mode: Dynamically searches and fetches tracks from curated playlists like "Top 50 Global" and "Today's Top Hits" to test your knowledge of mainstream music.Comparison Logic: Uses a custom algorithm to generate multiple-choice options (4 per question) and track difficulty levels.Cross-Origin Ready: Configured for deployment with Vercel and local development environments. Tech StackBackend: Python, FlaskFrontend: JavaScript (Vanilla), HTML5, CSS3API: Spotify Web APIAuthentication: OAuth 2.0Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), Flask (Backend) Installation & Setup1. Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/Srivibhu/TrackGuessr.git
cd TrackGuessr
2. Set Up Environment VariablesCreate a config.py file (or set environment variables) with the following credentials obtained from the Spotify Developer Dashboard:PythonFLASK_SECRET_KEY = "your_flask_secret"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = "your_spotify_client_id"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = "your_spotify_client_secret"
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI = "your_callback_url" # e.g., http://localhost:5002/callback
FRONTEND_URL = "your_frontend_domain"      # e.g., https://trackguessr.vercel.app
3. Install DependenciesBashpip install flask flask-cors requests
4. Run the ApplicationBashpython app.py
The backend will start on http://localhost:5000 (default) or 5002 as per your configuration.🔌 API EndpointsEndpointMethodDescription/loginGETInitiates Spotify OAuth login flow./callbackGETHandles the Spotify authentication callback./auth/statusGETReturns login status, display name, and avatar./api/quiz/top-tracksGETGenerates a quiz from the user's top 50 songs./api/quiz/global-hitsGETGenerates a quiz from current global top playlists./logoutGETClears the session and redirects to the frontend. How It WorksAuthentication: The app uses flask-session and CORS with supports_credentials=True to maintain a secure link between the Spotify API and the user's browser session.Quiz Generation: The generate_quiz_from_tracks logic takes a list of 50 tracks and selects 5 at random to be the "correct" answers. It then pulls 3 random "distractor" tracks from the remaining list to create a 4-option multiple-choice question.Global Hit Fallback: If a user has a new Spotify account with no listening history, the app is designed to search for "Global Top 50" playlists to ensure the game remains playable.Developed by Srivibhu Ponakala Computer Science Major @ UMass Amherst
